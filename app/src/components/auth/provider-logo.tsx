 * The mark the identity provider requires on a sign-in button.
 *
 * Drawn inline rather than fetched. This sits on the one screen somebody reaches before they have a
 * session, so a mark that arrives over the network is a mark that can be missing exactly when the
 * page has to be trustworthy, and a request to a third party from an unauthenticated page is a
 * request nobody asked for.
 *
 * Reproduced at its published colours because Google requires it: their guidelines say the standard
 * colour G, at its own aspect ratio, neither recoloured nor restretched. It is a trade mark used to
 * say "this button signs you in with them", which is what the guidelines are for.
 *
 * Drawn into the 18x18 box the button reserves for it. Google's G is not square, so it is centred
 * rather than stretched to fill.
 *
 * Google is the only mark. The identity provider admits `google`, `github` and `vercel`; Microsoft
 * and Okta are gone from this product, which serves individuals rather than companies behind a
 * directory. `github` and `vercel` are not drawn because their branding guidelines forbid the mark
 * being reproduced — Vercel's says to use its own button component, and GitHub's asks for a link
 * rather than a button. A branch configured with either would render this button's label with the
 * Google mark, which is wrong, and `sign.tsx` is where that should be handled rather than guessed at
 * here.
