 * few hundred kilobytes of somebody else's files. Putting either on `skills` would make the row
 * that every skill list reads carry a blob it does not draw, and would put the two on different
 * lifetimes: the pointer belongs to the author and is written when they press Save, while the cached
 * index is written by a background refresh and replaced whenever the branch moves. Splitting them is
 * what lets `listSkills` stay the query it is.

 * administrator. `skills` says a skill can only ask a Bot for what it was already granted, and that
 * is what lets anybody write one. A public repository read at run time adds no tool, opens no
 * credential and reaches no system the deployment does not already reach — the model gains the
 * ability to read prose that was published to be read. That argument does not survive contact with a
 * private repository, which is why `parseRepoRef` accepts only `github.com` and this stores no
 * token: there is nothing here that could be pointed at a company intranet.
 *
