/**
 * Whether a Bot may take one particular action on one particular page.

 * Mirrors the policy engine in CopilotKit's enterprise agent gateway rather than being re-derived, so
 * a rule written here means the same thing there. Kept from it: CEL expressions, `dry-run` vs
 * `enforce`, default-deny, and fail-closed evaluation. Added here: a `deny` list, because an
 * allow-only policy can only forbid one thing by withdrawing permission from everything.
 *
 * CEL instead of a rule table. The boundary a company wants is a sentence: "never click anything
 * that says Submit on a page outside our own domain". A table of columns can express the shapes we
 * thought of; an expression language can express the one they thought of. This is also the language
 * the enterprise gateway already speaks, so a rule written here means the same thing there.
 *
 * Precedence: deny beats allow. A rule that removes permission must never be
 * defeated by a broader rule that grants it, or a company cannot reason about what it has forbidden.
