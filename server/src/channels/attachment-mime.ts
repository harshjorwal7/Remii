 * The text claims this function will hand back under their own name.
 *
 * Built from `ACCEPTED_TEXT_MIME` rather than listed again, because the two
 * lists have to be the same list: a name returned here that `classifyAttachment`
 * does not accept is a file refused for a reason nobody can read, and a name
 * accepted there but missing here is a text file the byte guess relabels as
 * `text/plain` — a `.csv` silently becoming a `.txt`.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT DEAD CODE, AND THE BRANCH IT GUARDS IS NOT REDUNDANT WITH THE
 * `namesNoFormat` CHECK FURTHER DOWN. Two review rounds have now called it
 * dead, so the refutation is written down here rather than rediscovered a
 * third time.
 *
 * It is REACHED by every text claim: nothing between the top of
 * `sniffMimeType` and its use filters those out. `bytes.length === 0` returns
 * first, and `sniffImageType` returns first, but a `.csv` claiming `text/csv`
 * is neither empty nor an image, so it arrives here. The test "recognized
 * claims win outright once no image signature matches" walks that path.
 *
 * It also CHANGES THE ANSWER, which is the half that looks redundant and is
 * not. The tempting reading is that `if (!namesNoFormat(normalizedClaim))
 * return normalizedClaim` below would return `text/plain` for a `text/plain`
 * claim anyway, so this branch merely arrives at the same place early. That
 * is true for bytes that ARE text and false for bytes that are not, and the
 * false case is the whole point: delete this branch and a stripped executable
 * claiming `text/plain` falls through to that line, is returned as
 * `text/plain`, and is stored and served as accepted text from this app's own
 * origin on the client's word alone. With the branch it becomes
 * `application/octet-stream` and is refused. The test "bytes that are not
 * UTF-8 at all, claimed text/plain, are not text" fails the moment this is
 * removed.

 * A file's `type` field is whatever the uploading client said it was, and

 * header on its own origin. This function *resolves* that claim rather than
 * trusting it, but how much the bytes can settle differs sharply between the
 * two families of type this app accepts, and it is worth being exact about
 * which is which.
 *
 * For the four ACCEPTED IMAGE types the bytes decide outright. Each one has a
 * magic number in `sniffImageType`, so the bytes name the format, and the
 * claim is only ever a tie-breaker that the bytes can overrule — a JPEG
 * claiming `image/png` comes back `image/jpeg`.
 *
 * For the four ACCEPTED TEXT types the bytes decide much less. There is no
 * signature that distinguishes Markdown from CSV from JSON from prose; every
 * one of them is just UTF-8. So the bytes can only answer whether the file is
 * text AT ALL, never which text format it is, and the format that comes back
 * is the CLIENT'S CLAIM — corroborated by the UTF-8 check, but not verified.
 * A `.csv` uploaded as `text/markdown` is stored and served as Markdown, and
 * nothing here can tell. What the corroboration buys is narrower than
 * verification and still worth having: bytes that are not text cannot wear a
 * text name, so a binary blob can no longer be stored and served as
 * `text/plain` on this origin just by saying so.
 *
 * The corroboration is real content or nothing: a zero-byte file is refused
 * outright, because "these bytes decode as UTF-8" is trivially true of no
 * bytes and would otherwise wave an empty file through as accepted text.
 *
 * A claim that names nothing (blank, or a generic
 * "I don't know what this is" like `application/octet-stream`) is
 * discarded and the bytes are sniffed instead. But a claim that names a
 * specific format — `image/svg+xml`, `text/html` — comes back by name on
 * purpose, even though it is not verified against the bytes, because the
 * caller needs that name to refuse it (an inline SVG is valid UTF-8 text,
 * and laundering it into `text/plain` here would erase the one signal
 * that lets the caller block it). Identifying a format is not the same as
 * authorizing it: the caller MUST run this function's result through
 * `classifyAttachment` before anything is stored or served.
 *
 * The exceptions to "a specific claim comes back by name" are the eight
 * claims naming a type this app ACCEPTS. Naming a format the caller will
 * refuse is harmless; naming one it will store and serve is not, so those
 * eight names have to be earned from the bytes rather than asserted — the
 * four image names in full, from a signature, and the four text names as far
 * as bytes can go, from the UTF-8 check. Those two lists are
 * `ACCEPTED_IMAGE_MIME`, imported from `shared/attachments.ts` because the
 * composer screens against the same one, and `MIME_BY_LOWER_CLAIM`, at the top
